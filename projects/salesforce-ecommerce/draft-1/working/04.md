# Seamless Buying Experiences – Omnichannel or Bust

Modern B2B buyers have zero patience for clunky, fragmented buying journeys. This is especially true in industries like **manufacturing** and **healthcare tech**, where expectations have caught up to the B2C world. In fact, the global B2B eCommerce market is now a whopping **$32 trillion** (2025) – and heavy sectors such as advanced manufacturing and healthcare are driving much of that growth (39 Crucial B2B Marketing Statistics (2025) - SellersCommerce[^1]). Today's business customers demand the same **seamless, friction-free** service across mobile apps, websites, sales reps, and self-service portals that they enjoy as consumers. And if you don't deliver? They walk. It's that simple (and that brutal).

## Modern B2B Buyers Demand Seamless Omnichannel Experiences

The modern B2B buyer wants every interaction to be *easy* and *connected*. These buyers are **"digital-first"**: over half of life science and healthcare organizations expect **42%** of their sales to come from digital channels by 2024 (Salesforce Brings Commerce CRM, and Data to Healthcare and Life Science Companies - Salesforce[^2]), and across all B2B industries, companies expect **52%** of revenue to be via digital channels within two years (How B2B Sales Teams Win with Digital Commerce - Salesforce[^3]). What does this mean? It means your customers – whether factory procurement managers or hospital IT directors – **expect a unified experience** whenever they engage. They might research a product on their phone, build a cart on your website, then call a sales rep for some advice, and later finalize the purchase on a laptop. They assume this will be *seamless*, with no repeated forms, no lost data, and no jarring transitions. In short, B2B buyers now expect an **omnichannel** journey every bit as smooth as a top-tier consumer shopping experience (How B2B Sales Teams Win with Digital Commerce - Salesforce[^4]). Because business deals are often more complex than retail, their expectations are *even higher* than the average consumer's (How B2B Sales Teams Win with Digital Commerce - Salesforce[^4]).

## Omnichannel B2B Experience Metrics

- **52%** of B2B revenue expected to come from digital channels within two years
- **85%** of customers want consistent interactions across all channels
- **90%** of B2B buyers will turn to a competitor if your digital experience is poor
- **87%** would pay a premium for excellent e-commerce portals
- **80%** of B2B buyers use mobile at some point in their buying journey
:::

Crucially, today's buyers carry their expectations **across channels**. They expect vendors to have "connected processes like seamless handoffs between departments," and **85%** of customers want consistent interactions wherever they go (How B2B Sales Teams Win with Digital Commerce - Salesforce[^5]). Yet too often, companies drop the ball – **66%** of buyers say they frequently have to repeat or re-explain information to different reps or on different channels (How B2B Sales Teams Win with Digital Commerce - Salesforce[^5]). Imagine telling your story to an online chatbot, then having to start from scratch when a human sales rep takes over. That's exactly the kind of friction that drives buyers crazy.

## Friction = Churn: The High Cost of Clunky Journeys

Let's be blunt: a fragmented or frustrating buying journey is a **customer churn machine**. In the B2C realm, a famous UX stat tells us that **88%** of people are less likely to ever return after a bad online experience (50+ UX Statistics To Impress Stakeholders 2025[^6]). B2B buyers may be more patient in some ways, but when it comes to digital channels, their standards are just as unforgiving. Consider this: **87%** of business buyers say they would actually **pay a premium** to a supplier who provides an excellent e-commerce portal, and **90%** will **turn to a competitor** if your digital channel doesn't meet their needs (How B2B Sales Teams Win with Digital Commerce - Salesforce[^7]). That's right – nearly *all* your customers are ready to flee to the competition if buying from you is a hassle. The **ease of doing business** is often the deciding factor in loyalty. One industry survey found **76%** of B2B buyers feel technology has made it easier than ever to take their business elsewhere if they're unhappy (How manufacturers can best use Revenue Cloud - Simplus[^8]). In other words, your hard-won accounts will ghost you after one bad digital experience, no matter how great your product is.

We see the stakes clearly in the data. A dissatisfied online buyer won't stick around to complain – they'll just disappear. One report summed it up: "**Customers won't return after a bad experience**," and this holds as true for a $100,000 industrial equipment order as it does for a $10 t-shirt (50+ UX Statistics To Impress Stakeholders 2025[^6]). Furthermore, **90%** of B2B buyers with a positive mobile experience say they're likely to **buy again** from the same vendor, compared to only ~50% if the mobile experience is poor (39 Crucial B2B Marketing Statistics (2025) - SellersCommerce[^9]). That 40-point delta is life or death for repeat business. It means that if your mobile site or app makes them pinch-zoom or jump through hoops, half of them won't be back. For a business dependent on long-term customer value, that is unacceptable churn.

Friction points in B2B purchasing are well documented. Common complaints include lack of personalization, slow processes, and insufficient information. In fact, the **top pain points** for B2B buyers are lack of customization/personalization (39%), lack of real-time stock information (38%), and overly long purchasing processes (34%) (39 Crucial B2B Marketing Statistics (2025) - SellersCommerce[^10]). Notably, one-third of buyers also cite **lack of personalized pricing** and discounts as a major frustration (39 Crucial B2B Marketing Statistics (2025) - SellersCommerce[^11]). B2B customers often negotiate special pricing or contracts – if your e-commerce channel doesn't recognize their account and pricing terms, you're forcing them to call a rep or, worse, encouraging them to look elsewhere. All these friction points have a cumulative effect: they erode trust and **drive your customers into the arms of competitors**. With so many alternatives a click away, a clunky experience is simply a deal-breaker.

## Unified Commerce Journeys with Salesforce (No More "Hops" and Drops)

So what's the solution? The clear answer is to build **unified, omnichannel journeys** – and Salesforce Commerce Cloud combined with Revenue Cloud is built for exactly this purpose. These platforms let you create one continuous flow for the customer, even if they zigzag across channels. *Omnichannel or bust* isn't just a slogan; it should be your operating model. Salesforce's approach to unified commerce means **connecting every touchpoint**: e-commerce storefronts, mobile apps, sales reps armed with CPQ quotes, customer service interactions, even physical sales offices – all sharing the same data and view of the customer (Salesforce launches next-gen CommerceCloud for unified commerce[^12]). The new generation of Salesforce Commerce Cloud *"natively connects all aspects of commerce — B2C, direct-to-consumer and B2B commerce; order management; and payments; with sales, service, and marketing — on a single platform."* (Salesforce launches next-gen CommerceCloud for unified commerce[^12]). The result is a **complete view of the customer journey** with a shared catalog, pricing, and profile across every channel (Salesforce launches next-gen CommerceCloud for unified commerce[^13]). When you unify catalogs, pricing, orders, and customer data in this way, you can deliver the holy grail: **personalized, consistent interactions** that increase loyalty and revenue at every touchpoint (Salesforce launches next-gen CommerceCloud for unified commerce[^13]).

What does a unified Salesforce-powered journey look like in practice? Picture this scenario: A buyer at a medical device distributor browses your online catalog from her phone on Monday and adds a complex product to her cart. On Tuesday, she emails your sales rep with a few questions; the rep pulls up her **cart and account details instantly** (since Salesforce gives reps the same 360° view) and answers her queries without asking her to repeat anything she already entered. The rep uses Salesforce **Revenue Cloud** (which includes CPQ) to configure a custom price quote for a bulk purchase, then saves it to her account. Wednesday, the buyer logs into the self-service portal on her desktop, sees the tailored quote waiting in her cart (along with her negotiated pricing), and clicks **checkout**. The deal is done – no redundant data entry, no lost context, no frustration. This is the kind of **"start on one channel, finish on another"** flexibility that Salesforce enables by *connecting direct sales, partner sales, and online commerce* in one system (Transform Into a B2B Giant With Revenue Cloud - Salesforce[^14]). If a buyer begins a transaction through one channel and switches to another, they **can pick up right where they left off** (Transform Into a B2B Giant With Revenue Cloud - Salesforce[^15]). No wonder Salesforce calls it "seamless B2B experiences" – the technology ensures that every hop in the journey feels like a continuation, not a new ordeal.

Salesforce Revenue Cloud plays a pivotal role here by linking the traditionally siloed sales process with the commerce experience. It provides a flexible **configure-price-quote (CPQ)** engine that works for sales reps and also plugs into your website via APIs (Transform Into a B2B Giant With Revenue Cloud - Salesforce[^16]). This means a custom configuration or pricing term a rep creates in Revenue Cloud can flow to the customer's online account in Commerce Cloud instantly. **No data loss, no re-keying.** Likewise, if a customer self-configures a product or starts a quote online, a sales rep can seamlessly step in through the CRM to assist or finalize details. By **connecting sales, finance, and digital channels** on the back end, Salesforce ensures the customer always encounters a unified front end (Transform Into a B2B Giant With Revenue Cloud - Salesforce[^17]) (Transform Into a B2B Giant With Revenue Cloud - Salesforce[^14]). The payoff is huge: buyers feel understood at every step, and your team isn't scrambling to patch together information from emails, spreadsheets, and separate systems. It's all one system, one truth.

## B2B-Specific Features That Drive Omnichannel Success

Delivering a seamless omnichannel experience in B2B isn't just about merging data; it also requires features tailored to complex B2B buying. Salesforce Commerce Cloud and Revenue Cloud shine here as well, offering robust **B2B-specific capabilities** out of the box:

- **Self-Service Portals:** B2B buyers (especially for reorders or routine purchases) love the ability to serve themselves. A well-designed portal lets your customers place orders, check status, and manage their account **24/7** without calling a rep. This not only makes customers happier, but also reduces your cost to serve. Salesforce B2B Commerce, for example, uses the same data model as Sales Cloud CRM, so customers and reps are always in sync on orders and account info (Ovation Medical - Salesforce.com[^18]) (Ovation Medical - Salesforce.com[^19]). Buyers can log in to see their order history, easily reorder past items with one click, or even request a sales rep follow-up for new needs – all in one place (Ovation Medical - Salesforce.com[^20]). For instance, a pharmaceutical supplier might provide pharmacies with a self-service reordering portal. Salesforce Commerce Cloud's new features even allow **one-click reorders** based on past purchases, which dramatically decreases order time and effort (Salesforce Brings Commerce CRM, and Data to Healthcare and Life Science Companies - Salesforce[^21]). When reordering is as simple as clicking a button, you encourage repeat business by making it frictionless.

- **Account-Based Pricing and Personalization:** Unlike in B2C, pricing in B2B is often negotiated account by account. Salesforce Revenue Cloud (with CPQ) enables you to set up **contract-specific pricing**, volume discounts, and customer-specific catalogs that will automatically reflect in the commerce experience (39 Crucial B2B Marketing Statistics (2025) - SellersCommerce[^11]). That means when a buyer logs into your site, they see *their* price, not a generic list price – a critical trust factor. It tackles the pain point that **33% of B2B buyers** cite: not seeing personalized pricing or discounts online (39 Crucial B2B Marketing Statistics (2025) - SellersCommerce[^11]). Additionally, the platform's personalization extends to product recommendations and merchandising. Intelligent recommendation engines can offer related products or upsells tailored to the customer's industry or past behavior, just like Amazon does for consumers. This has a direct impact on revenue – personalized recommendations and search make it easier for buyers to find what they need and discover more, leading to **higher average order value (AOV) and increased loyalty** (How B2B Sales Teams Win with Digital Commerce - Salesforce[^22]). When your commerce site feels like it "knows" the customer (because it actually does, via CRM data), it builds loyalty and encourages larger purchases over time (How B2B Sales Teams Win with Digital Commerce - Salesforce[^22]).

- **Product Configurators and Guided Selling:** In manufacturing and tech, products can be highly complex or configurable. Salesforce's solution set addresses this through CPQ configurators that can also surface on the commerce site. Customers can configure a product (selecting components, sizes, features) in a guided flow on their own, *or* a sales engineer can configure it in Revenue Cloud and share a link or code with the customer. Either way, the configuration data is shared. No more PDF spec sheets faxed back and forth – it's an interactive, omnichannel configuration experience. For example, an industrial machinery supplier could allow a customer to build a custom part online and submit for quote, which a rep then fine-tunes in Salesforce CPQ and converts to an order without re-entering anything. This speeds up what used to be a lengthy back-and-forth process. Faster quotes mean faster deals: manufacturers that quote first win **60% more business**, according to industry research (How manufacturers can best use Revenue Cloud - Simplus[^23]). By streamlining complex product sales, you accelerate sales cycles and remove another source of friction.

- **Integrated Order Management and Service:** Omnichannel doesn't stop at checkout. What happens after the order is placed is just as important to CLV. Salesforce Commerce Cloud includes order management capabilities that connect with Service Cloud. The benefit? A customer can call support and the agent instantly sees everything about that customer's orders across all channels (Salesforce Brings Commerce CRM, and Data to Healthcare and Life Science Companies - Salesforce[^24]). If there's an issue, the agent can even **order on behalf** of the customer or make adjustments in real time in one system (Salesforce Brings Commerce CRM, and Data to Healthcare and Life Science Companies - Salesforce[^24]) (Salesforce Brings Commerce CRM, and Data to Healthcare and Life Science Companies - Salesforce[^25]). This continuity means whether a customer is on your site, talking to a rep, or speaking with customer service, everyone has the same view of the transaction. Problems get resolved faster, and opportunities for upsell can be identified by any team member with access to the unified data (Salesforce Brings Commerce CRM, and Data to Healthcare and Life Science Companies - Salesforce[^26]) (Salesforce Brings Commerce CRM, and Data to Healthcare and Life Science Companies - Salesforce[^25]). The result is a consistently positive experience throughout the customer's lifecycle.

By leveraging these features, companies eliminate the classic gaps in B2B journeys. No more guesswork about stock levels (buyers can see in real time). No more mysterious pricing (customers always see their correct price). No more delays waiting for a rep to process an order manually. It's all instant and transparent. And importantly, **mobile optimization** underpins all of this – Salesforce's responsive storefronts and mobile-first design ensure that whether on a phone or a desktop, the experience is equally smooth. Given that **80%** of B2B buyers use mobile at some stage of the buying journey (39 Crucial B2B Marketing Statistics (2025) - SellersCommerce[^27]), and that mobile experiences heavily influence whether they'll buy again (39 Crucial B2B Marketing Statistics (2025) - SellersCommerce[^9]), having a fast, user-friendly mobile interface is non-negotiable. If your customer can't complete a task easily on their smartphone while between meetings, you've injected friction. A seamless omnichannel strategy means *seamless on every device* too.

## Manufacturing Case Study: Chambers Gasket Frees Up Sales with Self-Service

To see omnichannel excellence in action, let's look at a real-world manufacturing example. **Chambers Gasket & Manufacturing Co.**, a custom gasket maker, realized their sales team was bogged down in low-value tasks. Reps spent hours simply typing in small orders for hundreds of minor accounts, instead of pursuing new big opportunities (Four Steps to Building a Self-Service B2B Online Storefront - Salesforce.com[^28]). As company president G. Michael Kenny put it, "About 75% of our accounts are under $10,000, but that's only 11% of our revenue. I wanted to drive those accounts to online ordering. That would free up my people to quote new business and create new opportunities..." (Four Steps to Building a Self-Service B2B Online Storefront - Salesforce.com[^29]). In other words, the lack of a self-service online channel was stifling their growth – salespeople were acting like data-entry clerks for small orders, and it was hurting the company's ability to focus on high-revenue deals.

Kenny's solution was to deploy a **digital self-service portal** using Salesforce B2B Commerce. With a small team (and even limited IT savvy), he took a lean approach: he personally attended a Salesforce boot camp and learned to implement the storefront in-house (Four Steps to Building a Self-Service B2B Online Storefront - Salesforce.com[^30]). The result was a streamlined B2B e-commerce site tailored to exactly what his customers needed: a quick, no-frills way to order the gaskets they already knew they wanted (Four Steps to Building a Self-Service B2B Online Storefront - Salesforce.com[^31]) (Four Steps to Building a Self-Service B2B Online Storefront - Salesforce.com[^32]). Chambers Gasket's portal includes features like **tiered pricing** (to encourage larger orders with bulk discounts) and a **quick order** form where customers can paste in part numbers and quantities directly into the cart (Four Steps to Building a Self-Service B2B Online Storefront - Salesforce.com[^33]). The guiding philosophy was "no bells and whistles... just make it as simple as possible. **Frictionless**," says Kenny (Four Steps to Building a Self-Service B2B Online Storefront - Salesforce.com[^32]).

The impact on customer lifetime value was immediate. Small customers embraced the convenience of the self-service site (no need to phone or email for every little order), and orders started flowing in online. Internally, this freed the sales team to focus on what really mattered – nurturing big clients and hunting new deals. While specific numbers for Chambers Gasket's outcome aren't public in this snippet, the qualitative result is clear: by **offloading low-revenue transactions to a seamless online channel**, the company unlocked capacity to grow the high-revenue side of the business. Essentially, they **multiplied their salesforce's effectiveness** without hiring anyone new, simply by removing busywork. This is a perfect example of how an omnichannel approach (in this case, adding a digital channel and connecting it to their Salesforce CRM) can boost efficiency *and* customer satisfaction simultaneously. Customers get a faster, easier buying experience, and the business gets more productive reps – a win-win that ultimately drives greater lifetime value from both small and large accounts.

## Healthcare Tech Case Study: Ovation Medical's Omnichannel Boost

In the healthcare technology arena, consider **Ovation Medical**, a provider of orthopedic medical devices. Ovation's business was built on repeat orders – clinics and distributors regularly replenishing products. However, the company's sales reps were spending an inordinate amount of time manually inputting up to $10,000 worth of orders *per rep per day*, rather than developing new business (Ovation Medical - Salesforce.com[^34]). This created a bottleneck: high-volume repeat buyers were eating up all the sales team's time with basic ordering. Ovation saw the writing on the wall – this model wasn't scalable, and it certainly wasn't friction-free for customers or reps.

::: {.callout-success}
## Success Story: Ovation Medical

**Company:** Ovation Medical  
**Industry:** Orthopedic Medical Devices  
**Challenge:** Sales reps spent excessive time on manual order entry instead of new business development  
**Solution:** Deployed a Salesforce-powered self-service digital commerce portal in just four weeks  
**Results:**  
- 50% reduction in repeat order processing time
- Doubled sales rep productivity
- Each rep can now manage up to 400 customer accounts
- Streamlined reordering process for customers
- Freed up sales team to focus on new business development
:::

In mid-2020, Ovation Medical deployed a **robust digital commerce portal** powered by Salesforce to automate and streamline those repeat orders (Ovation Medical - Salesforce.com[^35]). Remarkably, they launched the new system in just four weeks (Ovation Medical - Salesforce.com[^35]), and it immediately transformed their operations. The self-service portal let customers log in and place their own reorders in seconds, with all their prior order history and account-specific pricing available at a glance (Ovation Medical - Salesforce.com[^20]). The results have been outstanding: since going live, Ovation cut repeat order processing time **by 50%** – what used to take hours of back-and-forth now happens in a few clicks (Ovation Medical - Salesforce.com[^36]). In turn, this efficiency doubled the productivity of Ovation's sales reps, who can now each manage up to **400 customer accounts** at once (previously unthinkable) and spend far more time **landing new business** instead of typing in orders (Ovation Medical - Salesforce.com[^36]). In short, the sales team's capacity *and* the customers' ordering speed both skyrocketed thanks to an omnichannel approach. Reps focus on relationships and complex sales, while the digital channel handles the routine flow of orders flawlessly.

This kind of outcome has direct implications for customer lifetime value. By making reorders *effortless*, Ovation is protecting and expanding the lifetime value of existing customers – they've made it so easy to keep buying that customers have little reason to churn or even consider competitors. At the same time, the freed-up sales energy means more new customers are being acquired and onboarded into that same efficient system. It's a textbook case of **faster sales cycles and more repeat business** through seamless commerce: reorders that took days now take minutes, and satisfied repeat buyers keep coming back because the experience is hassle-free. Ovation's VP of Sales summed it up well: the platform put smaller repeat business on "autopilot" and **freed up reps to engage in meaningful conversations** about new products – driving incremental growth on top of the retained base (Ovation Medical - Salesforce.com[^19]) (Ovation Medical - Salesforce.com[^37]). In an industry where relationships and ease of doing business are paramount, this omnichannel strategy became a true **CLV multiplier**.

## Mobile and Continuity: Critical to CLV

These case studies underscore two especially critical factors for maximizing customer lifetime value: **mobile optimization** and **channel continuity**. B2B buyers are constantly bouncing between devices and contexts – a procurement manager might start researching on her phone during a commute, then switch to a desktop at the office to finalize an order. If at any point the mobile experience is poor (slow loading, hard to navigate) or the transition between devices isn't seamless, you risk losing the customer. Recall that a positive mobile experience makes **90%** of B2B buyers likely to purchase again, whereas a bad mobile encounter drops that likelihood to ~50% (39 Crucial B2B Marketing Statistics (2025) - SellersCommerce[^9]). That is a huge swing. It means every aspect of your digital channel *must be mobile-friendly* and retain the user's context. Salesforce Commerce Cloud addresses this with mobile-responsive design and features like persistent carts tied to the customer's login – so the cart they started on the phone is right there when they log in on their laptop later.

Likewise, continuity across channels builds trust. If your customer never has to repeat themselves – if your website, your sales rep, and your support team all know who they are and what they need – they feel valued. That translates to loyalty. Conversely, making a customer re-introduce themselves or re-explain an issue erodes goodwill fast. It's telling that **85%** of customers expect consistent, informed interactions across departments, yet most companies still force **66%** of people to rehash their info as they get passed around (How B2B Sales Teams Win with Digital Commerce - Salesforce[^5]). The message is clear: invest in connecting your channels and data, or pay the price in customer attrition. A unified commerce platform ensures that, for example, a client's special discount that your sales rep arranged also applies seamlessly on the website, or that a service agent can see the exact status of an order placed online an hour ago. Every handoff that *doesn't* drop the ball is a reason for that customer to stick with you for the long haul.

## Conclusion: Omnichannel as a CLV Multiplier

It's time to be honest with ourselves: **seamless commerce isn't a luxury – it's a CLV multiplier** that businesses of all sizes (yes, even SMBs) can't afford to ignore. In this chapter, we've seen that modern B2B buyers in manufacturing, healthcare tech, and beyond won't tolerate friction. They reward companies that make purchasing easy, and they punish those that don't. The data is unequivocal – great omnichannel experiences lead to **higher order values, faster sales cycles, and more repeat business**, all of which expand customer lifetime value. Companies like Chambers Gasket and Ovation Medical have proven that even traditional industries can leap forward by embracing unified commerce. They eliminated pain points, delighted their customers, and reaped tangible growth in revenue and loyalty.
