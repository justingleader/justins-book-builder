SMB Success Stories: Phased Implementations of Salesforce Commerce & Revenue Cloud

Planet DDS (Dental Software SaaS) – Phased CPQ Rollout Boosting Sales and Efficiency

About the company: Planet DDS is a mid-sized healthcare tech firm offering cloud-based dental practice software. They faced complex pricing and discounting processes managed in spreadsheets, leading to inconsistent quotes and slow sales cycles ￼ ￼.

Phased implementation: The company partnered with a Salesforce integrator to roll out Revenue Cloud in stages. They first deployed Salesforce CPQ in a sandbox to standardize product bundles and pricing, then moved to production with controlled discount rules and a 3-tier approval workflow for special pricing ￼ ￼. In the next phase, they integrated DocuSign for e-signature on contracts and migrated historical contracts and price books into Salesforce, creating an end-to-end quote-to-cash process ￼ ￼. This phased approach ensured stakeholders could adopt each new capability (bundled quoting, approvals, e-signatures) in sequence.

Results: The impact on revenue operations and customer experience was dramatic. Key outcomes included:
	•	47% increase in sales after bundling products in packages (driving higher deal sizes) ￼. This indicates a significant uplift in average order values and customer lifetime value through more comprehensive offerings.
	•	30% increase in overall ROI and 27% faster quote turn-around time, thanks to automated pricing and approvals ￼. Sales reps can configure quotes much more quickly, reducing quote generation time by over a quarter.
	•	Improved customer experience: Quotes are more consistent and error-free, leading to a 12% rise in customer satisfaction scores ￼. Clients receive prompt, accurate proposals rather than waiting on manual paperwork. Internally, employees reported higher morale with tedious quoting tasks automated ￼.

(This success could be visualized with a before-and-after process flow: previously manual quote creation vs. the new automated CPQ workflow. The phased rollout (CPQ → e-signature → data integration) could also be shown as a timeline of milestones.) ￼

Brewing Supplier (Craft Beverage B2B) – Guided Quoting in Phases for Personalized Customer Journeys

About the company: A leading supplier of brewing ingredients (serving craft brewers, winemakers, and distillers) needed to improve its B2B buying experience. As an SMB in manufacturing/distribution, they offered complex pricing (volume-based, multi-currency) and found their quoting process was slow and not tailored to different customer segments ￼.

Phased implementation: The company adopted Salesforce CPQ (Revenue Cloud) with a focus on the Multi-Dimensional Quoting (MDQ) feature. In the initial phase, they configured MDQ to handle quotes that span multiple time periods and product dimensions, allowing more customized quotes for each buyer segment ￼. Next, they set up dynamic price rules and integrated dual currencies (USD and CAD) so that North American customers automatically see correct pricing in their currency ￼. This phased approach (first deploying tailored quoting templates, then layering in pricing rules and currency support) ensured each enhancement improved the buyer experience step by step.

Results: The new CPQ solution streamlined both customer experience and internal sales operations:
	•	45% reduction in quoting time – Sales reps generate quotes nearly twice as fast as before ￼. Automated pricing and pre-configured bundles eliminated manual calculations, dramatically speeding up the quote turn-around.
	•	Personalized quotes and higher win rates – The CPQ’s guided selling produces tailored proposals (e.g. volume discounts for “privileged” loyal customers vs. standard pricing for others), which boosted sales team performance and deal conversion ￼. Customers felt they were getting personalized service, improving loyalty and repeat business.
	•	Improved accuracy and self-service potential – With pricing logic standardized in the system, quotes are consistent and error-free. The company noted a “more neat and user-friendly configuration” for sales reps and a smoother, guided flow to process deals quickly and accurately ￼. This lays the groundwork for future phases, such as a customer self-service quote portal, since the backend pricing is already automated.

Healthcare Manufacturer (Medical Uniform Equipment) – Quote-to-Cash Transformation in Stages Yields 3× Growth

About the company: This Georgia-based manufacturer produces automated surgical scrub dispensing systems for hospitals – a niche in healthcare tech and logistics. As a growing mid-market business, it struggled with a traditional, manual quoting process and lengthy proposal approvals, which hampered sales productivity. Leadership sought to digitize the quote-to-cash process in phases to improve efficiency and scale revenue.

Phased implementation: The company implemented Salesforce Revenue Cloud (CPQ) as the core of its transformation. In Phase 1, they replaced manual quote generation with Salesforce CPQ to handle proposal creation, incorporating product configuration and pricing logic ￼ ￼. Next, they configured a 3-level approval process for discounts and special terms, automating what used to require back-and-forth emails ￼ ￼. In a subsequent phase, they introduced new subscription product models via CPQ (for recurring revenue) and ensured quotes could flow directly into orders/invoices (integrating with their ERP/finance systems). By rolling out these capabilities sequentially – first the CPQ foundation, then approval automation, then subscription support – the firm hit milestones that each delivered incremental value.

Results: The stepwise quote-to-cash digitization paid off in both top-line and efficiency metrics:
	•	3× increase in sales growth after the full CPQ implementation ￼. By the time all phases were complete, the company tripled its sales (relative to baseline), a testament to how faster, smarter quoting can unlock revenue.
	•	25% of sales reps’ time saved on proposal paperwork, as the CPQ automatically generates proposals and contracts ￼. This time was reallocated to selling activities, contributing to more deals and a 27% improvement in sales productivity (more deals closed per rep) ￼.
	•	Higher win rates and retention: With a simpler quoting tool, the sales team responded to inquiries faster and with more accurate info, leading to better customer satisfaction and loyalty. Internally, the user-friendly system saw quick adoption by the team, and the streamlined approvals removed friction from the sales cycle ￼. The COO noted that what used to take weeks for a quote and contract now happens in days – a transformation that could be illustrated in a before/after process flow diagram (manual steps eliminated in favor of automated CPQ workflow).

SchooLinks (EdTech SaaS) – Adding Revenue Cloud Billing to an Existing CPQ for End-to-End Automation

About the company: SchooLinks is a growing education technology platform that provides K-12 school districts with tools to improve student performance. As a B2B SaaS provider, SchooLinks had already implemented Salesforce CPQ for quoting its software packages. However, billing was handled in QuickBooks, creating a disconnect between quoting and revenue recognition. They devised a two-phase strategy to unify their quote and bill process to improve revenue operations and customer lifetime value (by reducing churn).

Phased implementation: In Phase 1, SchooLinks used Salesforce CPQ to configure and quote complex school district subscriptions. Phase 2 focused on implementing Salesforce Billing and integrating it with their CPQ and QuickBooks finance system ￼. This addition of the Billing module (part of Revenue Cloud) meant that once a quote was accepted, invoicing and payment schedules could be handled natively in Salesforce, aligned with the CPQ data. The integration also pulled invoice and payment information back into Salesforce, giving sales and support a full view of account status. Thomas West, SchooLinks’ Accounting Manager, emphasized the importance of planning: “Thunder (the implementation partner) did a great job making sure that we were solving for the correct problem and solving it in a way that made sense long term. Everything went smooth from the planning to go live.” ￼. This quote highlights how a careful phased plan ensured a painless go-live. (A timeline diagram could illustrate Phase 1: CPQ deployment, and Phase 2: Billing integration, as distinct milestones.)

Results: By completing the Revenue Cloud suite with Billing, SchooLinks realized several benefits:
	•	Streamlined revenue operations: By aligning the quoting and billing systems on one platform, they eliminated manual data transfers. This improved efficiency and billing accuracy, as invoices are now generated directly from approved quotes ￼. Financial reports (ARR, revenue schedules) are more trustworthy and up-to-date, which the team noted led to “better insights from more accurate financial reporting.” ￼ ￼
	•	Improved cash flow and lower churn risk: The new solution provided an on-platform snapshot of each account’s health – from quote to payment status – allowing the team to proactively manage renewals and address any payment issues. Having this visibility is expected to drive down churn by ensuring no customer slips through the cracks after the sale ￼. Additionally, revenue recognition is more consistent, and proration of school contracts (for mid-year starts, etc.) is handled automatically, saving the finance team significant effort.
	•	Higher user satisfaction: The internal users (sales ops and finance) are much happier with the unified system than the old QuickBooks workaround ￼. SchooLinks even gave the implementation partner a 5-star CSAT review for the project ￼. With quoting-to-billing now seamless, sales reps can sell confident that billing will be correct, and accounting can trust the data – fostering a smoother customer experience from initial quote through ongoing subscription billing.

Tremco (Building Materials Manufacturer) – Unified Commerce & Quoting Platform in a Multi-Phase Digital Transformation

About the company: Tremco is a manufacturer of construction and roofing materials that serves a wide network of contractors and distributors. The company (mid-market in the manufacturing sector) historically managed customer orders and quotes through manual processes and disparate systems. To improve the B2B customer experience and eliminate revenue leakage, Tremco undertook a massive phased transformation to build a modern self-service commerce portal tightly integrated with their sales quoting and ERP systems.

Phased implementation: Tremco’s approach was multi-pronged, addressing both customer-facing commerce and internal sales operations. Key components were implemented in parallel:
	•	Salesforce B2B Commerce Cloud was deployed as a modern e-commerce storefront for distributors, replacing phone/email ordering with an online portal ￼. This portal was designed with self-service capabilities: customers can log in to see personalized pricing, place orders, manage their account users, track shipments, and easily reorder from past order history ￼ ￼.
	•	Salesforce CPQ was implemented alongside to power a new digital quoting tool for Tremco’s sales agents ￼. This tool automated special pricing requests (customer-specific job quotes) and allowed sales reps to get approvals within Salesforce instead of via manual methods ￼. Guided selling features help reps configure the right products for a given project, ensuring accurate quotes.
	•	Integration of systems was a crucial phase: the team integrated Salesforce with Tremco’s ERP (SAP) via middleware (Enosix) and connected a Product Information Management system (inRiver) for rich product data ￼. This ensures the commerce site and CPQ use real-time product availability and pricing from SAP, so customers and sales reps always see up-to-date stock and pricing ￼ ￼. They also integrated Stripe for online payments. By phasing in these integrations, Tremco unified front-office and back-office, creating a seamless flow from online order or sales quote to fulfillment.

Results: The phased rollout of an integrated Commerce + Revenue Cloud solution led to significant improvements in customer experience and scalable revenue ops:
	•	Efficient self-service for customers: Buyers can now complete tasks that previously required manual intervention – from getting product information to ordering and tracking shipments – all through the online portal. This dramatically improved the customer experience, meeting modern B2B buyer expectations. The new portal handles high order volumes with ease, and during a major product launch it successfully processed millions of dollars of orders with no bottlenecks, something not possible before ￼ ￼. Tremco effectively transformed its CX from manual to self-service commerce, a shift that can be depicted in a before/after process diagram.
	•	Unified quote-to-cash and higher productivity: Sales agents now have a single source of truth. Quote approvals and special pricing are managed within Salesforce, and once approved, can be turned into orders on the portal or in the ERP without re-entry. This eliminates duplicate work and errors. Tremco’s Senior Director of Digital Strategy, Susan Oakes, praised the approach: “Shift7 spent the time to understand our business needs and worked with us to come up with creative solutions and deliver on our next-generation commerce and quoting platforms.” ￼. The integrated system means reps spend less time chasing approvals or inventory info and more time selling value to customers.
	•	Scalability and revenue growth: With more processes automated and customers empowered to self-serve, Tremco can scale its business profitably without a linear increase in headcount ￼. The company is now positioned to handle growth (e.g. adding new product lines or expanding globally) much more easily on the unified platform. In short, the buying process became more efficient for all parties – prospects, customers, and sales teams – which sets the stage for higher customer lifetime value through better service and for capturing more sales that might have been lost in the old manual process ￼. The Senior Director noted that the team’s partnership was key: “They have become our trusted partners… able to quickly translate ideas to reality.” – underscoring that ongoing, phased innovation is part of Tremco’s DNA now ￼.

Each of these case studies showcases how small-to-midsize businesses can succeed with a phased Salesforce implementation strategy. By breaking the project into clear milestones (whether deploying CPQ and then Billing, or launching an e-commerce portal integrated with existing sales tools), these companies mitigated risk and realized value at each step. The common thread is a focus on improving customer experience (through faster, more personalized service) and optimizing revenue operations (through automation and data integration). The measurable outcomes – from double-digit percentage improvements in quoting speed and accuracy, to multi-fold sales growth and higher retention – demonstrate the power of Commerce Cloud and Revenue Cloud in driving customer lifetime value and operational excellence for SMBs.
