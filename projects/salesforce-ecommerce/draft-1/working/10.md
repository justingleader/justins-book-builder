Case Study: Brave Mobility – Rapid B2B Commerce Transformation

Challenge: Brave Mobility, a veteran-owned medical equipment provider, relied on legacy systems and manual workflows for processing orders. These outdated processes made it hard to scale their B2B sales – every order required tedious data entry, and reporting on sales performance was painfully slow ￼. The company needed an efficient online ordering system to improve the buying experience for its institutional customers and to keep up with growing demand.

Solution: Partnering with Stack Intelligence (a certified Salesforce implementation partner), Brave Mobility deployed Salesforce B2B Commerce and Order Management as a unified ordering platform. Incredibly, the new B2B ordering portal went live in just 8 weeks, versus an expected 3–4 month timeline ￼. This rapid implementation ($$$ diagram of implementation timeline) gave Brave a modern e-commerce interface integrated with their CRM backend. The solution streamlined how orders flow from customers to fulfillment, with real-time visibility at each step. In short, what used to be a fragmented manual process became a seamless digital order journey.

Results: The impact was immediate. Key outcomes included:
	•	8-week launch: A full B2B commerce and order management system was up and running in two months ￼, accelerating time-to-value.
	•	Streamlined orders: Orders are now managed end-to-end in one system, eliminating duplicate data entry and errors ￼.
	•	Faster reporting: Sales and operations teams gained instant, "quick and easy" reporting on orders and revenue, instead of waiting on manual reports ￼.
	•	Scalability: The new platform scales with the business, enabling Brave to handle growth without bottlenecks ￼.

"Thanks to Stack, we were able to launch our new ordering system within 8 weeks!" one Brave Mobility executive noted, highlighting how the project's speed saved the team "so much time and headaches" ￼. With an online portal in place, Brave's customers can now place orders more easily and frequently, directly contributing to higher customer lifetime value through increased repeat business and loyalty.

Case Study: AWP Safety – Streamlining Quotes with Revenue Cloud CPQ

Challenge: AWP Safety (Area Wide Protective) provides traffic control services and equipment for construction projects. Their sales team was bogged down by an inefficient quoting and estimating process – generating a custom quote for each job was slow and error-prone. These delays not only frustrated potential clients but also meant lost revenue when opportunities went cold. To keep up with demand and improve the buyer experience, AWP needed to modernize how quotes were created, approved, and turned into orders.

Solution: In partnership with Salesforce experts, AWP Safety implemented Salesforce Revenue Cloud, specifically the Configure-Price-Quote (CPQ) tool integrated with Sales Cloud and Service Cloud. This end-to-end solution automated the quote-to-order process and ensured data flowed smoothly from sales reps to back-office teams ￼. Sales reps could easily configure services and pricing for each job, and management had clear visibility into the pipeline for faster approvals. The new CPQ system also tied into AWP's billing schedules, ensuring that once a quote was accepted, the downstream billing and project setup happened without manual effort.

Results: Transforming the quoting process had a direct impact on AWP's bottom line:
	•	Accelerated sales cycle: By eliminating spreadsheets and manual calculations, quote turn-around time shrank dramatically (Salesforce CPQ users have seen up to 80% faster quote delivery in similar scenarios ￼).
	•	Higher win rates: Accurate, professional quotes delivered faster helped AWP close deals before competitors could respond. Fewer delays meant fewer opportunities lost to indecision.
	•	Revenue growth: AWP "dramatically increased revenue by optimizing the quoting & estimating process" after rolling out CPQ ￼. Faster quotes and fewer errors translated into more jobs won and improved margins on each service contract.
	•	End-to-end efficiency: With Sales, Service, and CPQ fully connected, AWP streamlined its business processes from initial quote to service delivery ￼. This reduces admin workload and lets the team focus on customer needs instead of paperwork.

AWP's leadership attributes these gains to the smarter sales process enabled by Revenue Cloud. When quotes that once took days go out in hours, customers notice the responsiveness. In turn, AWP has strengthened relationships with clients – boosting long-term loyalty and repeat business (key drivers of lifetime value). The lesson: even in traditional industries like construction services, digitizing core sales workflows can significantly increase customer value and growth.

Case Study: Funlab – Engaging Customers with Marketing Cloud

Challenge: Funlab operates entertainment venues (bowling, arcade, and mini-golf centers) under multiple brands. As the company expanded to 50+ venues across regions, it struggled to keep customer engagement personal and effective. Customer data was siloed by brand and channel, limiting Funlab's ability to cross-sell experiences or tailor marketing to individual guest preferences ￼ ￼. For example, email campaigns had to be duplicated and tweaked for each brand and segment manually, consuming countless hours ￼. Front-line staff lacked visibility into guests' past interactions beyond a single venue, making it hard to provide VIP-level service. In short, Funlab was leaving money on the table by not fully knowing or engaging its customers throughout their journey.

Solution: Funlab undertook a Salesforce-led digital transformation focused on Marketing Cloud and a unified customer 360 view. With the help of a Salesforce partner, they connected Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, and Marketing Cloud so that all guest interactions (whether booking a game online or checking in at a venue) feed into one profile ￼. They then built automated guest lifecycle journeys using Marketing Cloud's Journey Builder, ensuring each customer receives timely, personalized emails and offers based on their behavior ￼. Campaign production that used to take days is now streamlined with dynamic content – marketers create one email template that automatically personalizes for each brand and segment, drastically reducing manual work ￼. Funlab also adopted Marketing Cloud Intelligence for real-time engagement analytics, so they can tweak campaigns on the fly ￼. This omni-channel strategy (spanning email, web, and in-venue touchpoints) nurtures guests from their first visit into loyal repeat customers.

Results: The payoff for Funlab has been significant, directly aligning with improved customer lifetime value:
	•	+140% Email engagement: Year-over-year growth in email performance (opens, clicks) of 140%, meaning customers are far more responsive to Funlab's outreach ￼.
	•	+30% Active customers: A 30% increase in active guests across their venues, showing that more people are coming back for additional visits and events ￼.
	•	+28% CLV: On average, guest lifetime value increased by 28% after implementing these personalized marketing journeys ￼. Customers are spending more over the duration of their relationship with Funlab's brands.
	•	50% efficiency gain: Internally, process efficiency in marketing improved by half, freeing up 50% more time that the team can now invest in strategy and creativity instead of manual tasks ￼.

"Our Salesforce-led transformation has delivered initiatives that created more shared experiences for Funlab's guests and employees, and we are seeing positive results. Our engagement numbers are growing, and we are more efficient, which allows us time to be more strategic," says Tracy Tanti, Funlab's Head of Customer Relationships and Retention ￼. In other words, connecting data and automating engagement didn't just boost metrics – it freed the team to focus on bigger-picture growth efforts. Funlab's marketing and service personalization directly foster greater loyalty and repeat revenue, increasing the lifetime value of each guest relationship.

The Big Takeaway: Fast ROI and Long-Term Loyalty

These success stories highlight a common theme: SMBs that invest in Salesforce solutions (with the right partners) can quickly drive ROI and sustain growth by deepening customer relationships. Whether it's automating a quote process or personalizing at scale, the end result is happier customers who stick around longer and spend more. In fact, some businesses have reported triple-digit increases in customer lifetime value after embracing a multi-cloud Salesforce strategy ￼.

The formula for boosting CLV is clear. Combine speed and expertise – a knowledgeable implementation partner can cut deployment times dramatically, as seen with Brave Mobility's 8-week launch. Streamline the experience – removing friction (AWP's instant quotes) and silos (Funlab's 360° customer view) makes it easier for customers to do more business with you. And finally, focus on engagement and value – by using tools like CPQ to offer the right products, or Marketing Cloud to deliver the right message at the right time, SMBs can treat every customer like a VIP. That translates into more repeat purchases, higher average spend, and loyal relationships measured in years.

In short, investing in your Salesforce "customer stack" is an investment in customer lifetime value. The cases in this chapter prove that even smaller companies, with the help of skilled Salesforce partners, can achieve enterprise-level outcomes: faster growth, higher retention, and a healthier bottom line. The path to greater CLV is paved with faster quotes, smarter commerce, and personalized marketing – and it's available to any business willing to take the leap.  ￼ ￼
