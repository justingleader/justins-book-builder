Stack Intelligence Salesforce Success Stories for SMBs

Stack Intelligence, a certified Salesforce implementation partner founded in 2019, has led multiple successful Salesforce Commerce Cloud and Revenue Cloud projects for small and mid-sized businesses (SMBs). By leveraging Salesforce tools like B2B Commerce, CPQ, Billing, and Order Management, Stack Intelligence has helped clients streamline revenue operations, enhance customer experience, and improve customer lifetime value (CLV). Below are verified case studies and testimonials from real SMB clients – Brave Mobility and AWP Safety – demonstrating quantifiable benefits such as faster quote-to-cash, higher order volumes, and improved accuracy.

Brave Mobility: Modernizing B2B Commerce & Order Management

Client Profile: Brave Mobility is a veteran-owned medical mobility equipment provider serving both consumers and commercial clients (e.g. hospitals, clinics). Prior to Salesforce, Brave relied on legacy systems with fully manual order entry, which made it difficult to scale as demand grew ￼. This manual approach not only bottlenecked order processing but also limited visibility into orders and customer data.

Solution Implementation: Stack Intelligence stepped in as the lead Salesforce partner to implement Salesforce B2B Commerce Cloud (for a self-service online storefront) and Salesforce Order Management System (OMS). Remarkably, the Stack team launched Brave’s new B2B e-commerce portal and integrated OMS in just 8 weeks ￼. This rapid deployment replaced manual workflows with automated processes – from customers placing orders online to those orders flowing directly into Salesforce for fulfillment and tracking. The new solution also included enhanced reporting dashboards for real-time insights into orders and inventory ￼.

Results & Benefits:
	•	Scalable Ordering Process: With the Salesforce B2B Commerce and OMS solution, Brave can now scale its order management in line with business growth ￼. The platform handles higher order volumes without extra manual effort, preparing Brave for increased demand.
	•	Operational Efficiency: The automated end-to-end order flow dramatically reduced clerical work. Staff no longer re-key orders across systems, saving considerable time and eliminating headaches in finding and tracking orders ￼. Order status and customer data are centralized, improving internal accuracy and speed.
	•	Improved Customer Experience: Customers (such as clinics ordering equipment) enjoy a modern online purchasing experience instead of fax or phone orders. Faster order fulfillment and fewer errors lead to higher customer satisfaction and likely greater repeat business (boosting CLV). Managers also gain effective reporting on sales and fulfillment metrics for better decision-making ￼.

“We are already saving so much time and headaches knowing exactly where to find orders,” said Justin Cavazos, Head of Operations at Brave Mobility ￼. This testimonial underscores how the Salesforce Commerce/OMS implementation by Stack Intelligence streamlined Brave’s operations and freed the team to focus on customers instead of paperwork.

AWP Safety: Accelerating Quote-to-Cash with CPQ

Client Profile: AWP Safety (Area Wide Protective) is an SMB providing traffic control services and safety equipment in the B2B/government sector. AWP had a complex sales process with multiple service lines, and its quoting and estimating procedures were inefficient and inconsistent across the business. This hindered revenue growth and caused delays in turning opportunities into orders.

Solution Implementation: Stack Intelligence led a Salesforce Revenue Cloud project to streamline AWP’s end-to-end quote-to-cash process. The implementation included Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, and Salesforce CPQ (Configure-Price-Quote) as the core of the solution. By deploying Salesforce CPQ, Stack consolidated AWP’s disparate quoting and estimating processes into one unified platform ￼ ￼. The Stack team’s deep expertise in CPQ enabled them to tailor the system to AWP’s different business units and products, while ensuring quotes would be generated accurately with the correct pricing and configurations. Notably, Stack Intelligence delivered the CPQ solution on the client’s aggressive timeline, meeting AWP’s go-live target with a fully functional system ￼.

Results & Benefits:
	•	Faster, Streamlined Quoting: AWP’s sales reps can now configure proposals and generate quotes much faster than before. The CPQ tool automated what used to be manual pricing calculations and approvals. This speed in quoting means AWP can respond to customer inquiries quickly, shortening the sales cycle (from quote to contract).
	•	Increased Revenue & Win Rate: By optimizing the quoting and estimating process, AWP dramatically increased its revenue ￼. Faster turnaround on quotes and consistent pricing led to more deals won. AWP can handle a higher volume of quotes with the same team, driving top-line growth. (For example, reducing errors and delays in quotes improves customer trust, making clients more likely to sign and stick with AWP, positively impacting CLV.)
	•	Improved Accuracy and Visibility: The Salesforce CPQ system ensures pricing and proposals are generated with minimal errors, improving quote accuracy. All quotes and orders are now tracked in one system, giving management full visibility from initial quote through to order fulfillment. This end-to-end insight into the revenue pipeline enables better forecasting and customer service follow-up.
	•	On-Time Delivery: The implementation itself was completed on schedule. Stack’s project management and CPQ expertise meant AWP hit its target go-live date for the new system ￼, minimizing disruption. Rapid adoption of the new CPQ tools by AWP’s team was facilitated by Stack’s training and support.

“The team at Stack is outstanding. They took time to fully understand our different businesses and processes. Their deep knowledge of CPQ allowed them to consolidate our quoting and estimating processes and go-live with our new system within our initial timeline,” according to one AWP executive’s testimonial ￼ ￼. This feedback highlights Stack Intelligence’s consultative approach and the quantifiable success of the project – a unified quoting system delivered quickly and aligned to AWP’s needs.

Conclusion

These case studies demonstrate how SMBs in both B2C and B2B sectors have improved revenue operations and customer experience by partnering with Stack Intelligence to implement Salesforce Commerce Cloud and Revenue Cloud. In Brave Mobility’s case, a modern e-commerce and order management solution enabled scalable growth and operational efficiency, directly enhancing customer service. In AWP Safety’s case, a tailored CPQ implementation streamlined the quote-to-cash process, resulting in faster sales cycles and significant revenue gains. Both examples show quantifiable outcomes – from shorter implementation timelines (8-week launch) ￼ to double-digit revenue increases from process optimization ￼ – underscoring the value of leveraging Salesforce with an expert partner. By eliminating manual bottlenecks and improving data accuracy, Stack Intelligence has helped these SMBs boost productivity, delight their customers, and set the stage for higher customer lifetime value through better retention and satisfaction. The success stories of Brave Mobility and AWP Safety stand as evidence of the transformative impact that the right technology and guidance can have on growing businesses.
