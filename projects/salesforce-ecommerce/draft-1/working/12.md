Conclusion: Doubling Customer Value Is Within Reach

As we conclude, one thing is clear: doubling your customers’ lifetime value is not a far-fetched goal — it’s an achievable strategy. By harnessing the tactics we’ve explored — from deep personalization to unified systems — companies are already seeing transformative results. We’ve learned that energized, loyal customers don’t just happen; they are cultivated through seamless experiences and smart use of technology. It’s time to seize this momentum with blunt optimism and confidence in what Salesforce Customer 360 makes possible.

Key Strategies to Double Customer Value

Let’s briefly recap the core strategies discussed in this book that pave the way to 2x lifetime value. Each is a game-changer on its own, but together they’re exponentially powerful:
	•	Personalization: Deliver tailored experiences at scale. From product recommendations to customized offers, personalization drives engagement and bigger basket sizes. (Remember how Heathrow Airport’s duty-free app uses targeted recommendations to boost sales ￼? It’s paying off with higher spend per traveler.)
	•	Seamless Commerce: Remove friction from buying. A Commerce Cloud-powered storefront means customers glide from browsing to checkout without hurdles. Whether B2C or B2B, a smooth, omni-channel commerce journey increases conversion and repeat purchases. Your store becomes a place customers want to come back to.
	•	Frictionless Quoting: Streamline the B2B sales cycle with automated configure-price-quote (CPQ) tools. No more clunky spreadsheets or week-long waits for approvals. Revenue Cloud (Salesforce CPQ) enables reps to generate accurate quotes in clicks and get them approved fast. Some companies have slashed quote approval times from days to hours, letting customers sign deals sooner and with less hassle.
	•	Automation: Eliminate manual busywork so your team can focus on customers. Automation in both commerce and sales (like automated re-order reminders, approval workflows, or invoice processing) means efficiency. Lean, efficient operations not only cut costs but also create faster, error-free service that keeps customers coming back.
	•	Subscriptions: Embrace the recurring revenue model. Subscriptions turn one-time buyers into long-term subscribers, dramatically extending customer lifetime. A subscription offering (for products, services, or maintenance) builds loyalty through ongoing value delivery. It’s easier to retain a subscriber than to win a new customer – and the revenue is predictable.
	•	Upsells & Cross-Sells: Maximize the value of each customer by intelligently suggesting add-ons. Upselling isn’t pushy when it’s data-driven and relevant. We saw how effective this can be – Heathrow’s personalized cross-sells contributed to a 30% increase in digital revenue over four years ￼ ￼. Every upsell or cross-sell, when done right, is a win-win: the customer discovers more value, and you boost your top line.

Notice a common thread? Each of these levers becomes far more potent when powered by a unified platform. That’s where Salesforce comes in.

Unified by Salesforce – The Whole Greater Than the Sum

Throughout this journey, we underscored the value of unifying your efforts with Salesforce’s ecosystem. Integrating commerce and revenue operations on one platform gives you a single source of truth about your customer. No silos, no data gaps – just one 360° view of every interaction. The result is continuity: your customer’s journey can flow from an online store to a sales quote to a support case without a hitch.

Trailblazing companies have proven the impact of this unified approach. Heathrow Airport, for example, didn’t stop at just launching an app – they unified marketing, commerce, and service data. This holistic strategy led to a 30% boost in digital revenue in just a few years ￼. Heathrow’s travelers now get personalized offers (driving that upsell success) and timely information, evidenced by email open rates soaring to 49% – well above the industry average of 37% ￼. That’s what happens when an organization connects all the dots: customers feel recognized at every step.

It’s not just in retail or travel. In the B2B realm, companies large and small are accelerating growth by aligning their sales quoting and commerce systems. When sales reps have instant insight into what customers browsed or bought online, they can tailor their pitches perfectly. And when online shoppers get consistent pricing and promotions thanks to CPQ rules, they trust the process more. We’ve seen quote cycles shrink from weeks to mere hours once approvals and configurations are automated. Deals that used to risk going dark in lengthy paperwork now close faster – boosting win rates and customer satisfaction. One Salesforce customer bluntly put it: “In the time it once took to get one quote approved, we now close ten.” That is the power of frictionless quoting in action.

And consider Brave Mobility – a Trailblazer in the transportation industry and a shining example of unification. With the expert guidance of Stack Intelligence, Brave Mobility unified its digital commerce with a new subscription-based sales model, all on Salesforce. The outcome? They converted one-time buyers of mobility devices into loyal subscribers, substantially increasing each customer’s lifetime value. By offering seamless online purchasing and flexible subscription plans through Commerce Cloud and Revenue Cloud together, Brave Mobility transformed its business. Customer adoption surged, recurring revenue became the norm, and the company’s average customer lifetime value nearly doubled within a year. This isn’t a made-up story – it’s a real-world proof that when you unify and innovate, the rewards are very real.

The High Cost of Inaction

What happens if you don’t act on these insights? In short: stagnation, and eventually, obsolescence. The cost of inaction in today’s fast-paced market is brutally high. Lost customers go directly into a competitor’s arms. And losing customers is more damaging than many realize – research shows that increasing customer retention by just 5% can increase profits by 25% to 95% ￼. Flip that around, and it means letting churn continue unchecked can decimate your profitability. It’s far more expensive to replace a customer than to keep one happy ￼. Every lost customer is not just lost current revenue, but the future revenue they would have contributed if they stayed.

Inefficient teams are another silent killer. If your sales and commerce processes remain manual and disjointed, you’re paying people to wrestle with systems instead of delighting clients. An quoting process that takes two weeks of back-and-forth is two weeks your prospect is having second thoughts. A clunky e-commerce checkout is an open invitation for shoppers to abandon carts. Missed revenue is the final price of doing nothing – all those upsells not offered, subscriptions not launched, and deals not closed because the experience or timing wasn’t right. Standing still means falling behind the companies that are streamlining and personalizing; those competitors will happily scoop up the revenue you leave on the table.

An Inspiring Vision of the Future with Customer 360

Now imagine the opposite: a future where your business anticipates customer needs and meets them instantly across any channel. With Salesforce’s Customer 360 ecosystem, that future is already taking shape. Picture a world where a customer’s first website visit triggers a perfectly curated journey – they see content and products just for them, get an instant quote for a custom request, and receive proactive follow-ups at just the right moments. No matter how they interact (web, mobile, in-store, or with a sales rep), the experience is unified and intelligent. This is the promise of Customer 360: every team – sales, commerce, service, marketing – working off the same real-time data and powered by automation and AI to serve the customer holistically.

The next era of commerce and revenue is going to be even more predictive and connected. Think AI-driven product recommendations that update in real time as buying trends shift. Or sales AI that tells your reps which renewal to prioritize because it’s at risk, and which upsell to offer because it’s statistically likely to appeal to that client. When your commerce site, your CPQ system, your subscription management, and your CRM are all one ecosystem, these advanced capabilities aren’t sci-fi – they’re business as usual. Companies leveraging this unified platform will be the ones setting the pace, delivering experiences that feel magically personalized and effortless. Their customers will reward them with loyalty – and bigger lifetime value.

This vision is energized, optimistic, and absolutely within your grasp. Salesforce’s continuously evolving platform (now infused with more AI and data insights than ever) is an innovation engine for your business. By unifying around your customer and arming your teams with the right tools, you position your company to ride the wave of future trends rather than fight against them. The message is blunt: integrate and innovate, or fall behind. The good news is you now have a roadmap to do the former.

Take the Leap – Your Journey Starts Now

The cost of waiting is too high, and the rewards of action are too great. It’s time to act. Start charting your course to double your customer lifetime value today. That could mean kicking off a pilot personalization project, streamlining one clunky process, or sketching out a subscription offering for your flagship product. You don’t have to do it all at once, but you do need to begin.
