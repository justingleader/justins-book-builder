## Color Usage Guidelines

### Brand Recognition
1. **Consistent Usage**: Always use the Primary Blue as the dominant color in all communications to maintain brand recognition.
2. **Color Proportion**: Aim for approximately 60% Primary Blue, 30% neutral colors (whites and grays), and 10% Primary Orange in most designs.
3. **Digital Consistency**: Ensure colors display consistently across different devices by using proper color profiles.

### Functional Usage
1. **UI Elements**: Use Primary Blue for primary buttons and navigation elements.
2. **Call to Action**: Reserve Primary Orange exclusively for call-to-action buttons and important highlights.
3. **Information Hierarchy**: Use color to establish clear information hierarchy—primary colors for important elements, secondary and neutral colors for supporting content.

### Accessibility
1. **Contrast Ratio**: Maintain a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 between text and background colors.
2. **Text Legibility**: Never place text directly on the Primary Orange without ensuring adequate contrast.
3. **Color Blindness**: Do not rely solely on color to convey meaning; always use additional visual cues.

### Industry-Specific Applications
1. **Manufacturing**: When targeting manufacturing clients, the Primary Blue should be more prominent to convey reliability and precision.
2. **Healthcare**: For healthcare audiences, balance the Primary Blue with more white space to convey cleanliness and clarity.
3. **B2B**: For general B2B communications, maintain a professional appearance with judicious use of the Primary Orange as an accent.

1. **Primary Combination**: Primary Blue + White + Light Gray
2. **Accent Combination**: Primary Blue + Primary Orange + White
3. **Subtle Combination**: Secondary Blue + Light Gray + White
4. **Text Combination**: Primary Text on White or Light Background; White text on Primary Blue

### Print Considerations
1. **Color Matching**: Use Pantone color matching for print materials to ensure consistency.
2. **Paper Selection**: Consider paper stock when selecting colors—uncoated papers may absorb more ink and affect color appearance.
3. **CMYK Conversion**: Always use the specified CMYK values rather than converting from RGB for print materials.

### Digital Considerations
1. **Web Safe**: Ensure colors appear consistent across browsers and devices.
2. **Gradient Usage**: When creating gradients, use Primary Blue to Secondary Blue for a cohesive look.
3. **Dark Mode**: In dark mode interfaces, use lighter tints of the Primary Blue against darker backgrounds.

1. Do not alter the specified color values.
2. Do not create new color combinations without approval.
3. Do not use Primary Orange as a background for large areas.
4. Do not place colored text on similarly colored backgrounds.
