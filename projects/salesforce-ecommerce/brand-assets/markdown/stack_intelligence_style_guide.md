## Brand Elements

Stack Intelligence's visual identity is built around the following key elements:

- **Geometric "S" Logo Mark**: A distinctive 3D geometric shape that forms the letter "S"
- **Bold Blue "STACK" Text**: Strong, confident typography in the primary blue color
- **Lighter Gray "INTELLIGENCE" Text**: Secondary text in a lighter gray for visual hierarchy

- **Professional Business Appearance**: Sophisticated visual identity appropriate for B2B contexts

The brand identity conveys expertise in Salesforce Commerce and Revenue Cloud implementations, with a focus on professionalism, reliability, and technological sophistication.

## Logo Usage

### Logo Variations

Stack Intelligence has four primary logo variations that should be used according to specific contexts:

1. **Full Logo with Icon and Text** (Stack Intelligence With Logo.png)
   - Primary logo for most applications
   - Use when introducing the brand in formal communications
   - Ideal for letterheads, business cards, and presentations

2. **Words Only Logo** (Stack Intelligence Words Only.png)
   - Use when the brand is already established in the context
   - Suitable for headers in documents and presentations
   - Works well in horizontal spaces where height is limited

3. **Icon Only Logo** (Just S Logo.png)
   - Use for social media profiles, favicons, and app icons
   - Suitable for small applications where text would be illegible
   - Can be used as a design element when the full logo appears elsewhere

4. **Full Logo in JPG format** (STACK LOGO.jpg)
   - Functionally identical to the full logo with icon and text
   - Use when PNG transparency is not required or supported

### Color Variations

The Stack Intelligence logo should primarily appear in the following color variations:

1. **Primary Blue** (#2a368e)
   - Default color for the "STACK" text and the "S" icon
   - Provides strong brand recognition and visibility

2. **Light Gray** (#c8c8c8)
   - Used for "INTELLIGENCE" text in the full logo
   - Creates visual hierarchy and sophistication

3. **White (Reversed)**
   - For use on dark backgrounds or the Primary Blue background
   - Ensures visibility and contrast

4. **Black (Monochrome)**
   - For use in black and white documents or when color printing is unavailable
   - Should be used sparingly when color options are available

### Clear Space Requirements

To maintain the logo's visual integrity, always maintain a minimum clear space around it:

- **Minimum Clear Space**: Equal to the height of the "S" in "STACK"
- This clear space should be free from text, graphics, and other visual elements
- Increase clear space whenever possible for optimal visual impact

### Size Requirements

To ensure legibility and brand recognition, observe these minimum size requirements:

1. **Full Logo with Icon and Text**:
   - Print: Minimum width of 1.5 inches (38mm)
   - Digital: Minimum width of 150 pixels

2. **Words Only Logo**:
   - Print: Minimum width of 1 inch (25mm)
   - Digital: Minimum width of 100 pixels

3. **Icon Only Logo**:
   - Print: Minimum width of 0.5 inches (13mm)
   - Digital: Minimum width of 32 pixels

### Incorrect Logo Usage

To protect brand integrity, avoid these common mistakes:

1. Do not stretch or distort the logo
2. Do not rotate the logo
3. Do not change the logo colors outside of approved variations
4. Do not add effects such as shadows, glows, or outlines
5. Do not place the logo on busy backgrounds that reduce visibility
6. Do not rearrange or alter the relationship between the icon and text
7. Do not enclose the logo in shapes unless using the approved icon-only version
8. Do not use the logo at sizes smaller than the minimum requirements
