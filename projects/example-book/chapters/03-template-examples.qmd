## Code Blocks

The code-block template enhances code display with titles and captions.

::: code-block
title: app.py
language: python
caption: Example Python function for calculating factorial

def factorial(n):
    """Calculate the factorial of n."""
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)
        
# Example usage
result = factorial(5)
print(f"The factorial of 5 is {result}")
:::

::: code-block
title: styles.css
language: css
caption: CSS for a responsive button

.button {
  display: inline-block;
  padding: 10px 20px;
  background-color: #4CAF50;
  color: white;
  border-radius: 4px;
  text-align: center;
  transition: background-color 0.3s;
}

## How Templates Work

Templates work by providing reusable HTML and LaTeX code that can be customized with parameters. To use a template:

1. Define the template in your config.yaml file or as separate files in the templates directory
2. Use the `:::` syntax in your Markdown to apply the template
3. Provide parameters to customize the template's appearance

The template system supports both inline templates (defined directly in config.yaml) and file-based templates (stored in the templates directory).
