# AI-Generated Images

This chapter demonstrates the integration of OpenAI's image generation capabilities within our book.

## Example Image

Here's an example of an AI-generated image:

```{openai-image}
prompt: A serene landscape with mountains and a lake at sunset
```

The image above was generated using OpenAI's DALL-E model. The image is automatically generated when the book is built, and it's included in both PDF and EPUB outputs.

## How It Works

The image generation process happens automatically during the book build process. When Quarto encounters a code block with the `openai-image` class, it:

1. Sends the prompt to OpenAI's API
2. Receives the generated image
3. Saves it to the images directory
4. Embeds it in the final output

You can generate different images by changing the prompt in the code block.

## Direct Image Reference

Here's the same image referenced directly:
