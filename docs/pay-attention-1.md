## Pay Attention
Using callouts is an effective way to highlight content that your reader give special consideration or attention.
:::

#### Icons

In addition to controlling the appearance of the callout, you can also choose to directly suppress the icon by setting the global option in your document (or project) yaml:

```yaml
callout-icon: false
```

or by setting an attribute directly on the callout:

```markdown
::: {.callout-note icon=false}
