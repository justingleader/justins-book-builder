(This content is largely identical to the section [Reference Formats: Docusaurus](#reference-formats-docusaurus), focused on user guidance rather than options reference. Key aspects covered include the workflow, previewing, rendering, configuration with `_quarto.yml`, handling code blocks, callouts, tabsets, HTML/MDX blocks, and LaTeX math rendering via WebTeX or KaTeX.)
