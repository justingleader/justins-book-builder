## Output Formats: GFM (GitHub Flavored Markdown)

Source: [GitHub (GFM) â€“ Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/gfm.html)

(This content is largely identical to the section [Reference Formats: GFM](#reference-formats-markdown-gfm), focused on user guidance rather than options reference. Key aspects covered include using the `gfm` format, creating READMEs, preview modes, math rendering via WebTeX, and using Quarto with GitHub Wikis.)
