## Output Formats: HTML Lightbox Figures

Source: [Lightbox Figures â€“ Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-lightbox-figures.html)

(This content is largely identical to the section [Authoring: Lightbox Figures](#authoring-lightbox-figures), focused on user guidance rather than options reference. Key aspects covered include enabling lightbox globally or per-image, disabling lightbox, creating image galleries using the `group` attribute, customizing lightbox options (match, effect, description position, loop, CSS class), using lightbox with computational output (including subfigures), and advanced customization for computational plots.)
