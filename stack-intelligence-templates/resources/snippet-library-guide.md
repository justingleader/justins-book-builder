## Template Validation

The Stack Intelligence templates include a validation system that checks your document for compliance with template guidelines. To use validation:

1. Include the template type in your document's YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: "My Document"
template_type: "executive_brief"
---
```

2. Valid template types include:
   - `executive_brief`
   - `whitepaper`
   - `case_study`
   - `ebook`

3. When rendering your document, the validation system will check for:
   - Required sections for your chosen template type
   - Recommended sections (optional but suggested)
   - Document length guidelines
   - Template-specific requirements

4. Any validation errors or warnings will be displayed during the rendering process.
